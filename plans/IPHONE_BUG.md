# Plan: IPHONE_BUG

- [x] Reproduce the scroll jump path in code and identify where render resets scroll on iOS.
- [x] Add scroll preservation for vocab answer submission so the viewport stays in place after Check/Enter.
- [x] Verify behavior in related submit handlers and keep focus logic intact.
- [x] Update spec checklist and add commits per spec item.
- [ ] Run tests (pnpm test, pnpm build) and fix any issues.
