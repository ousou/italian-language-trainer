[ ] Feature: Verb conjugation: When pressing Next verb, move focus to infinitive, and activate the text box.
[ ] Bug: Verb conjugation jumps strangely on iphone and Chrome, after answering for one conjugation form. Does not happen on desktop or Android and Chrome (at least the one I tested).
[ ] Feature: Verb conjugation: On mobile, make sure the keyboard entry keeps open when one conjugation form has been typed in, and enter has been pressed. It would be nice to be able to right away enter the next word, without having to click the text box again.
[ ] Feature: Verb conjugation: Let the user skip the entire verb with next verb, even if they haven’t entered all forms (or even the infinitive). Just score everything not entered as zeros.
[ ] Feature: If the word is almost correct (the Damerau–Levenshtein distance is one), then show yellow text and say “Almost!”. Then allow the user another try before scoring the word as incorrect. This should work the same in both vocabulary and verb conjugation (so don’t allow two tries anymore in verb conjugation, unless first try is almost right).
