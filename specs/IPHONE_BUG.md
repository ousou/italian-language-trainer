[x] On IPhone, both on Chrome and Safari, in the vocabulary training, whenever a word is entered and enter is pressed or the Check button is pressed, the page scrolls all the way up to the top, and the Italian Language trainer text is set. Instead, we want to keep the screen in the same location, so the user sees the answer and can move on to the next word. This is how it works on Desktop (Ubuntu/Firefox) and Android (Chrome.)
